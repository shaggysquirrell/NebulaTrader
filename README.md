In the year 2028 scientists made a discovery that would be detremental to the survival of the human race. The JWST detected a Mars sized planetoid that is on course to intersect the solar system.
We had 80 years to prepare for a possible slingshot out of the suns influnce or put in an unhabitable zone. Time came and went, we progressed... Pulse engines, Warp engines, multiplanet colonies, space colony stations...
However it came to a reckoning when time drew closer to what sceintist have determined would be the big freeze. Earth would be hurled from the solar system and with it life, all it would have left was its geothermal energy kept insulated 
by the frozen oceans. 

You are on this day in 2108 in a 2069 era space station with broken thrusters needing to preform a prograde burn to escape the earths influnce and make it to the Mars Colony heading to Teegarden's Star b. Humanities one of a few
possible life sustaining exoplanets. You must repair your station around your doomed rock and find refuge in the space colony "Demeter's Garden".
